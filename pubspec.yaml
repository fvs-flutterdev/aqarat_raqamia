  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.
  flutter_lints: ^2.0.0

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
# following page: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/langs/
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Changa
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Changa-Bold.ttf
    - family: Changa-regular
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Changa-Regular.ttf
    - family: Changa-Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Changa-Medium.ttf
    - family: Changa-ExtraBold
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Changa-ExtraBold.ttf
    - family: Changa-Light
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Changa-Light.ttf
